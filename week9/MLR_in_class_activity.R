# when we have two or more predictors in the model, the output changes based on the order of the
# predictors when using Type I. You can see the sums of squares values differ between the two outputs,
# but all we changed between the two models is the order of `weight.L3` and `species`.
# Using sequential fitting, the order of predictors in the model determines which predictor will claim the 
# redundant explained variation. So, in mod_no_interaction, the predictor `weight.L3` is listed first, and it claimed 
# the redundant explained variation such that the variation explained by species is returned after accounting for weight.L3
# The opposite is true for mod_no_interaction_switch. You can see this in the outputs based on the sums of squares values
